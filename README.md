# Snakes And Ladders Wheel

Milovana Webtease

## Idea

3 Rings in each other
Hit right field to go to next ring
Hit wrong field to go to previous ring
Hit certain field on last ring to finish game
Hit certain fields to reverse direction (from left to right to right to left)
If you miss the right field a new round beginns

Move by throwing a dice (1-6)

1 Ring = 8 Fields\
2 Ring = 16 Fields\
3 Ring = 24 Fields\
1 Field = Goal\
49 Fields in total

### Probabilities

![Probabilities](https://github.com/BrightSprinkler/SnakesAndLaddersWheel/blob/master/Menu/D6%20Probabilities.jpg?raw=true)

[Calculation Tool](https://github.com/BrightSprinkler/SnakesAndLetterWheelProbabilities)

70 % of time the game will finish within 100 dice rolls.
This will take the player max 200 minutes (3.3 hours). The average time at 50 rolls would be ~1.5 hours (the time of 2 minutes per field is only assumed).

20 % of time the game will finish within 200 dice rolls.
This will take the player max 400 minutes (7 hours) (the time of 2 minutes per field is only assumed).

The times can be halfed by aiming for a max duration per field of 1 minute.\
Kwnoing this the existing idea of reoccurring characters needs to be changed:

- Less reoccurring characters
  - Only snakes and ladders
  - Win field will use both characters

## Characters

Reoccuring characters every ring
Reoccuring character has similar task -> difficulty might increase per time visited

~~1 Char for Ladders/Win (vertical)\
1 Char for Snakes (vertical)\
2 Chars for Reverse (horizontal)\
4 Chars for X-Lines\
32 Chars for remaining fields~~
_see Probabilities for me details_

1 Char for ladders
1 Char for snakes
46 Chars for remaining fields

Win field = both characters from ladder and snake

1 Hidden char that appears if you edge or cum without permission
ends tease after 3 unallowed edges

## Tasks

- stroking
  - different bpm
  - different durations
  - different techniques (main hand, reverse hand, only head, ...)
- edging
  - multiple
  - holding
- cbt (optional? -> what if turned of?)
  - ball slapping
  - ball punching
  - ball squeezing
  - different intensities
